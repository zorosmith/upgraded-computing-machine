This code is released as part of the Human Activity Detection project at Personal Robotics Lab at Cornell University. 

Currently two codes are available:
- Extracting features from sequence of human activity: 
    Refer to [Sung et al. ICRA 2012] below.
- Visualizing skeleton data for Cornell Activity Dataset 


===== How to run it? =====
1. Download Cornell Activity Dataset from 
        http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/humanactivities/data.php

2. Feature Extraction - Refer to README inside FeatureExtractor
